# SpaceClicker
Space Clicker is a 2D clicker game where the goal is to expand a simulated space company. You click on the screen and buy upgrades to expand your company and colonize the solar system. This is the first game I've ever made, took me five months to develop. I do plan to add additonal content later like achievements, auto clicking, and other celestial bodies.
